#1: Find the restaurants within r radius of user u's current location
(multi-table + WHERE)

SELECT      *
FROM        Restaurant AS R, User_Location AS UL, Address AS A
WHERE       R.aid IN
            (
                SELECT  A.aid
                WHERE   |/( (UL.lat - A.lat) ^ 2 + (UL.lng - A.lng) ^ 2 ) < r AND UL.uid = 'evanj'
            )
ORDER BY    |/( (UL.lat - A.lat) ^ 2 + (UL.lng - A.lng) ^ 2 ) ASC


#2: Sort restaurants by visit count during rainy weather
(multi-table + aggregation)

1. find all Condition entries that have 'rainy' as a record under weather
2. find all Visit entries that have corresponding Condition cid
3. for each Restaurant rid, average the Visit counts that occured with rainy
4. find the Restaurant rname, sorting by averaged Visit count

SELECT      R.rname, AVG(V.count)
FROM        Visit AS V, Restaurant AS R
WHERE       V.cid IN
            (
                SELECT  C.cid
                FROM    Condition AS C
                WHERE   C.weather = 'rainy'
            )
            AND V.rid = R.rid
GROUP BY    R.rname
ORDER BY    AVG(V.count) DESC

#3: Sort conditions by visit count for a particular restaurant
(multi-table + WHERE)

1. find the rid of the restaurant from its restaurant_name 
2. find the conditions associated with rid in Visit
3. sort the conditions by ascending visit count, returning the day_of_week, weather, and time


SELECT      C.day_of_week, C.weather, C.time, V.count
FROM        Condition AS C, Visit AS V
WHERE       C.cid IN 
            (
                SELECT  V.cid
                WHERE   V.rid = ANY
                (
                    SELECT  R.rid
                    FROM    Restaurant AS R
                    WHERE   R.rname = "The Saltshaker"
                )
            )
ORDER BY    V.count ASC

(should we do sorting in SQL??? How do we do sorting in SQL???)
