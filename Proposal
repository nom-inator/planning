Project 1: Where to EAT? - restaurant occupancy prediction (Foursquare + Weather API)

#Databases Needed:
Restaurant’s info and visiting counts with timestamp (from Foursquare),
Weather condition for specific place and time.

#Use Cases:
Case 1:
 Sort all restaurants that fit customer’s requirement at specific moment based on:
 			a. user’s favor (no lining up or most popular) 
 			b. current time, date, weather and location
			c. customer’s favourite list
Case 2:
Customer types in a restaurant, output recommended visit time (cold time)
Customer can add specific restaurant into an favourite list

Case 3:
Restaurant owner will see a dashboard for visiting statistic after logging in.

Case 4:
Restaurant owner can publish a coupon valid at specific time.
 
#Potential Problems:
Need information about restaurants’ open hours to avoid error recommendation.
How come a restaurant owner doesn’t know the visiting statistic of his own restaurant?  ⇒ use case #3 might be trivial … XD
How to efficiently get nearby restaurants based on coordinates?
 

#Other Application
Museums or hot places like Disneyland


#Contingency Plan:
	Discard use case #3 and #4
